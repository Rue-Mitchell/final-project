<h2>About the Joseph Magliochetti Leadership Summit</h2>
    <img src="img/JoeMag.jpg" class="left" alt="Joe Magliochetti photo">
   <p>
    The Leadership Summit is named in honor of Joseph M. Magliochetti, former CEO of the Dana Corporation, whose family provided the Endowed Chair of Business & Finance in order to support a values-centered education for business majors. </p>
    <p>
      The Joseph M. Magliochetti Leadership Summit is the premier event of the Lourdes University College of Business and Leadership. It serves as the catalyst for our region’s businesses to engage and encourage leaders of both publicly and privately-held companies to accept the challenge of leading in a socially responsible manner. We call together business professionals who are not only successful but are also passionate about positively transforming the communities in which they work and live. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The summit brings to the forefront for our students the ideology they are taught in the Lourdes University College of Business and Leadership: that success is measured in more than just dollars, it is measured in integrity, humanity, and philanthropy. This was Joe Magliochetti’s philosophy and it resonates through our teaching today. Funds from this event go toward programs that create business professionals who feel as well as think, who care as well as lead, and who give as well as earn. Our students graduate with a sense of responsibility, honor, and a firm. 
      <br>
      <br>
      We are proud to honor his legacy with the Joseph M. Magliochetti Leadership Summit.
