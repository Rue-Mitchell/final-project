<h2>About the Joseph Magliochetti Leadership Summit</h2>
    <img src="img/JoeMag.jpg" class="left" alt="Joe Magliochetti photo">
   <p>
    The Leadership Summit is named in honor of Joseph M. Magliochetti, former CEO of the Dana Corporation, whose family provided the Endowed Chair of Business & Finance in order to support a values-centered education for business majors. </p>
    <p>
    Joseph Michael Magliochetti was born in 1942 in River Forest Illinois, and attended the University of Illinois. He joined the Victor Manufacturing Company in 1966 as a management trainee. Dana acquired the company a year later. During his career, Mr. Magliochetti served as head of Dana’s European operations, ran its North American business and became Dana’s president in 1996. Mr. Magliochetti was a well-known executive in the automobile industry and became chief executive at Dana in 1999 and chairman in 2000. Known as Joe Mag, Mr. Magliochetti spent 37 years at Dana and was only the sixth chief executive since the company was founded in 1904. He was a forward-thinker with an emphasis on technology and market growth. He was also known as a leader who modeled integrity in both his professional and personal life. We are proud to honor his legacy with the Joseph M. Magliochetti Leadership Summit.
